To get familiar with cmake,

1. Write a simple .c file that will print “hello world”
2. Write CMakeLists.txt file to build an executable from the .c file.
3. Build binary from command line and run the binary. 

How to build this project?
```
cd problem1 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./hello_world
```
